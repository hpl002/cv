## Who am i?
Happy and sociable guy with a love for the outdoors. Avid cyclist, climber, skier, and novice barista.
I like to tinker with things and have no issue with trying to fix things myself, be it electronics, carpeting, mechanics, or software.
All in all, i like to figure out how things work and i am often described as a fairly practical person.

I can be described as candid, transparent, and engaged. However, this is two edged sword and i can also be blunt, uncaring, and too ambitious in my planning and scheduling. This is a balance that i continiously work to adjust and maintain, just like we all do.

Irregardless of the aforementioned i strive to communicate well and precisely as this is something that i deem unquestionably important. It's cheesy, but *communication is key.*

*Fun facts:* I have averaged over 70 000 minutes per year on Spotify for the past three years. In short, i love music!
